	<h1>
		squareplane
	</h1>
	<p>
		this is a game i made in about an hour or 2 in science class
		<br>
		<br>
		its called squareplane because i thought its funny because the game it was originally modelled off of was cube ground or something similar
		<br>
		<br>
		it's not what i would call good but its kinda fun i suppose
