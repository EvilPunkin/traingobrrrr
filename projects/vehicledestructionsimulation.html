		Vehicle Destruction Simulation
	</h1>
	<p>
		This is a blender addon designed to streamline the process of making vehicle destruction simulations. You assign parts of a mesh and it will automatically generate the other parts for you, which can then be fiddled with to your liking. Although it bears similarities to the RBC addon, it's not intended to replace it at all. This addon does destruction and is tailored for my personal needs, RBC is more well made tbh and better if you want a good car rig.
