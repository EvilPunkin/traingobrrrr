				Vehicle Destruction Simulation
			</h1>
			<p>
				This is a blender addon designed to streamline the process of making vehicle destruction simulations. You assign the parts of a mesh and it will automatically generate the physics and everything for you. Although it is relatively similar to the RBC addon, it's not intended to compete with it. It's just an addon made for me to learn blender python and to make a process of mine faster.
